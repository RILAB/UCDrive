Undergrad Centromere Drive

Here's a start at the paper.  We should start writing ASAP.  It's in latex, which will require a bit of a learning curve.  Please start working on your methods sections, and start adding in results as appropriate (GWAS, CENTC abundance, etc.).  It's all on github, so just commit and push your changes and we should be fine.  I recommend using [latexian](http://tacosw.com/latexian/) or [texshop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) for editing LateX.
