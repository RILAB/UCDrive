\section*{Notes}

Will delete this section later.  Some simple tips:
Bold can be done {\bf like this}.  Italics are \emph{easy} too.  Math formulas are also easy: $Area=\pi r^2$.
Here's how you enter a citation \cite{Wolfgruber2009}.
Here's another way to enter a citation \citep{Wolfgruber2009}.
All citations need to have a bibtex formatted entry in the file "references.bib" in this same repo. You can add comments to the file using "\%" which will not be shown in the final pdf.

Population structure was inferred computationally using \emph{structure} software version 2.3.4 accessed from \url{pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html}.  The basic algorithm of this software was first described by Pritchard, Stephens, \& Donnelly \cite{Pritchard2000} and extensions to the algorithm were described by Falush, Stephens \& Pritchard \cite{Falush2003}, \cite{Falush2007} and Hubisz, Falush, Stephens \& Pritchard \cite{Hubisz2009}. A randomly generated 10,000 SNP subset from Jiao et al dataset was used to generate q matrices and estimate natural log probability of the data for 1-20 maximum populations, \emph{K}.  The length of burn-in was 10000 and the number of MCMC reps after the burn-in period was 20000.  Candidate \emph{K} values were determined using the $\Delta$ K method and corresponding q matrices were used in further analyzes.

Genome-wide association analyzes (GWAS) of the Jiao et. al dataset were completed using TASSEL software version 4.0 accessed from \url{maizegenetics.net/tassel}.  Analyzes utilizing the program's general and mixed linear models (GLM \& MLM, respectively) were conducted using estimated CentC abundance as the phenotype.  Q matrices generated by \emph{structure} were employed in both the GLM and MLM analyzes.  Kinship matrices for Jiao et al. dataset were generated using TASSEL and included in the MLM analyzes only.

\section{Results}

The natural log probability of the data and  $\Delta$K values for 3 trials were examined, revealing candidate \emph{K} values at 3 and 12 assumed populations.
