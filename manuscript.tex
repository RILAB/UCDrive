\section*{Notes}

Will delete this section later.  Some simple tips:
Bold can be done {\bf like this}.  Italics are \emph{easy} too.  Math formulas are also easy: $Area=\pi r^2$.
Here's how you enter a citation \cite{Wolfgruber2009}.
Here's another way to enter a citation \citep{Wolfgruber2009}.
All citations need to have a bibtex formatted entry in the file "references.bib" in this same repo. You can add comments to the file using "\%" which will not be shown in the final pdf.  

\section{Introduction}

Centromeres are dense, heterochromatic regions on chromosomes that act as an assembly site for the kinetochore complex during meiosis and mitosis and link sister chromatids together.  The role of the centromere is almost universally conserved among eukaryotes, despite a lack of sequence similarity in the centromeres of closely related species \cite{Henikoff2001}.  Centromeric DNA is some of the most rapidly evolving sequence in eukaryotes \cite{Csink1998}, \cite{Henikoff2001} and is hypothesized to play a significant role in speciation \cite{Henikoff2001}.  The functional centromere is epigenetically defined by the presence of nucleosomes featuring a histone H3 variant unique to the centromere, called CenH3 \cite{Henikoff2001}.  CenH3 replaces the standard histone H3 in the H2A-H2B-H3-H4 histone core and is thought to be responsible for the centromere's exclusive heterochromatic state. 

In maize, the DNA sequence of the functional centromere is composed primarily of CentC satellites and retrotransposons \cite{Nagaki2003}.  Each maize centromere has a unique organization of these elements \cite{Ananiev1998}, yet functions in the same capacity.  CentC satellite tandem repeats are 156 base pairs in length, are localized in centromere regions, and are unique to maize \cite{Ananiev1998}.  The sequence of CentC is largely conserved between individuals but single nucleotide polymorphisms have been observed \cite{Ananiev1998}.

Here, we present evidence for/against drive on centromere repeat abundance in maize.     

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Estimation of CentC Abundance} %Nicole





\subsection{Genome-Wide Association Analyses} %Chris
Population structure was inferred computationally for a randomly generated 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) subset from Jiao et al dataset using \emph{structure} software version 2.3.4 accessed from \url{pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html}.  The basic algorithm employed in this software package was first described by Pritchard, Stephens, \& Donnelly \cite{Pritchard2000} and extensions to the method were reported by Falush, Stephens \& Pritchard \cite{Falush2003}, \cite{Falush2007} and Hubisz, Falush, Stephens \& Pritchard \cite{Hubisz2009}.  The software was used to generate Q matrices and to estimate the natural log probability of the data for 1-20 maximum populations, represented by \emph{K}.  The length of burn-in used in the analysis was 10000 and the number of MCMC reps after the burn-in period was 20000.  Candidate \emph{K} values were determined using the $\Delta$ K method and the resulting Q matrices, inferring relatedness, were used in further analyzes.

% add section about GWAS using TASSEL 

Genome-wide association analyzes (GWAS) of the Jiao et. al dataset were completed using TASSEL \cite{Bradbury2007} software version 4.0 accessed from \url{maizegenetics.net/tassel}.  Analyzes utilizing this software's general linear model and mixed linear model functions were conducted using our estimation of CentC abundance as the phenotype.  The general linear model analysis (GLM) relies on a least squares fixed effect linear model to determine association.  The mixed linear model takes into account random effects in addition to the fixed effects included in the GLM, yielding an analysis with a higher statistical power compared to the GLM analysis \cite{Yu2006}.  Q matrices generated by \emph{structure} were employed in both the GLM and MLM analyzes, and omitted in a separate MLM analysis in order to compare the effects of Q + K with K.  Kinship matrices for Jiao et al. dataset were generated using TASSEL and included in the MLM analyzes only.

GWAS results were visualized by constructing manhattan and Q-Q plots using the qqman \cite{Turner2014} R package accessed from \url{http://cran.r-project.org/package=qqman}.

\section{Results}

The natural log probability of the data and  $\Delta$K values for 3 trials were examined, revealing candidate \emph{K} values at 3 and 12 assumed populations.
